## Description

This project contains the code for Octarina's Webiste (https://octarina.netlify.app/). Octarina is a physics-based 3D puzzle platformer featuring a trapped little octopus who must find a way out and escape out of a sushi factory site. You play as an adorable little octopus, which is trapped inside an aquarium for its whole life. Not as a pet, but rather as a sushi ingredient. Escape your captivity and find a way out before it's too late! Use the sticky abilities of Octarina to jump, climb and cause mayhem in the factory.
